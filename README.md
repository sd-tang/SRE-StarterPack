# SRE - Starter Pack

This is the SRE Starter Pack.

Inspired by Google's Site Reliability Engineering practice, I try to build a business case for this to be introduced into my current workplace. As such, this repo will be kept private and only to be shared to the relevant stakeholders. It is my of intention to invite collaboration and contribution to this repo.

Hopefully this will trigger the SRE practice, which is an evolving implementation of the DevOps methodology and culture.
